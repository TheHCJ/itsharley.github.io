    <h1>Quacker unarchived??</h1>
    <h4 class="ghfont">13-11-2024 21:03 GMT+0</h4>
    <p>
        <strong>Quacker has been unarchived! I am writing this post to explain why and what will happen to the project going forward.</strong>

        <h2>Why?</h2>
        <p>
            Quacker was initially archived due to constant breakages from X's frequent changes, which made it challenging to create a read-only experience to help users ease off social media. When X started requiring users to log in just to view content, the app's purpose lost some of its value, as anonymous browsing was no longer possible. Maintaining an app that couldn’t offer anonynous access felt, well, a bit pointless.</p>
        <h2>So... what's next?</h2>
        <p>
            Moving forward, I’m taking a modular approach. Quacker will be divided into “social modules,” each handling a different social platform. This shift will make it much easier to maintain and adapt the app as platforms evolve. Rather than being built around one platform, Quacker can support a range of social networks, allowing for quick and easy expansion in the future. This way, the app stays lightweight, stable, and compatible with multiple social media services. </p>
        <h2>What's the status?</h2>
        <p>
            For now, I’ll be focusing on making the app more stable and lightweight. The modular “social modules” update will come after, but I don’t yet have an exact timeline for this major shift.
